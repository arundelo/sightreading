Sightreading game
=================

This is a game to practice reading diatonic intervals (in musical
notation).  It shows you two notes (with no clef or accidentals) and you
use your keyboard or the onscreen keyboard to type the appropriate
number.  For instance, if it shows you two notes that are a third apart,
you type a "3".  (This uses the [standard naming system for diatonic
intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29#Number),
which is one-based -- two notes on the same line are a unison, so you
type "1".)

TODO:
-----

- Improve interface.  (Animated visual feedback will make it easier for the
  user to understand what's happening.)
- Make the game start easy and get progressively more difficult in response to
  the user's skill.
- Intervals wider than an octave.
- Add an interactive tutorial.
